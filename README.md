# copier-chart-registry

This is just a copier template to spit out a Helm Chart Registry for use on Github. It works as a private or public registry, and it doesn't need to be named "charts" even though that's our convention.

See [Copier docs](https://copier.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) on how to install Copier and use this template or any other with it.
